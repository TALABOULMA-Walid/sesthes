When designing complex cyber-physical systems, engineers have to integrate numerical models from different modeling platforms in order to simulate the whole system and estimate its global performances. If some parts of the system are already available, it is possible to connect these real components to the simulation in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) approach. In this case, the simulation has to be performed in real-time where models execution consists in periodically reacting to inputs from the real components and providing numerical output updates. The increase of requirements on the simulation accuracy and its validity domain requires more complex models. Using such models, it becomes hard to ensure real-time execution without using multiprocessor architectures. FMI (Functional Mocked-up Interface), an increasingly common standard for model exchange and co-simulation, offers new opportunities for multicore execution of numerical models, by enabling intra model parallelization. One objective of this thesis is to define algorithms for extracting potential parallelism in a set of interconnected multi-rate models. Another one consists in proposing algorithms for the distribution and scheduling of models, taking into account their real-time, data dependencies and allocation constraints. Prior to this thesis, an approach has been developed at IFPEN which allows the parallelization of FMI models on multicore processors. In the first part of the thesis, improvements have been proposed to overcome the limitations of this approach. In particular, new algorithms were proposed in order to allow handling models that exchange data at different rates and schedule them on multicore processors. The algorithms allow also the optimization of the phase of analyzing the models structures and their data dependencies in order to compute their schedule on the multicore processor. Finally, the proposed improvements allow handling some specific constraints like mutual exclusion constraints and allow also more accurate measurements of the execution times of the models using a profiling technique. This thesis is part of a joint action IFPEN - INRIA in which INRIA brings its real-time systems experience to the numerical simulation challenges of IFPEN.
